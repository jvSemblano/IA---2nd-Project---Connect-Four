# IA---2nd-Project---Connect-Four

Welcome to Connect Four: The Game!
The objective of this program is for you to play against the computer and try to win.
It will use 2 different algorithms to choose the best play.
Enjoy!

Step by step:
1. Choose which algorithm (MiniMax or Alphabet) you wish the computer uses;
2. Select who should be the first player to make a move (PC or yourself);
3. Since this is a turn-based game, you will play, let the computer make it's move, play again and so on...
   Just select the column where you want your piece to drop (from 0 to 6);
4. Play until someone wins or it ends in a draw. Good Luck!
